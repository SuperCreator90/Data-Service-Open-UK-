# Webinars

## 1. Case Study
This webinar demonstrates the research potential of web-scraping by describing its role in generating a linked administrative dataset to study the causal effect of a regulatory intervention in the UK charity sector. Presented by [Dr Diarmuid McDonnell](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/diarmuid.mcdonnell.html) of the UK Data Service, this webinar will cover the process of scraping data about charities, practical and ethical implications, and the advantages and disadvantages of using this form of data for social science research more generally.

## 2. Websites as a Source of Data
This webinar delineates the value, logic and process of capturing data stored on websites. Presented by [Dr Diarmuid McDonnell](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/diarmuid.mcdonnell.html) of the UK Data Service, this webinar will cover the step-by-step process of collecting data from a web page, including providing sample code written in the popular Python programming language. It demonstrates web-scraping techniques for capturing real-time information on the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as for the authorâ€™s own research specialism (charitable organisations).

## 3. APIs as a Source of Data
This webinar delineates the value, logic and process of capturing data stored in online databases through an API (application programming interface). Presented by [Dr Diarmuid McDonnell](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/diarmuid.mcdonnell.html) of the UK Data Service, this webinar will cover the step-by-step process of downloading data via an API, including providing sample code written in the popular Python programming language. It demonstrates techniques for downloading public information on the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as for a range of other social science subjects (e.g., crime data via the Police UK API, business information via the Companies House API).
