# Reading List

The following are suggested books, papers, websites and other resources for developing your web-scraping and Python skills further.

### Web-scraping

Lau, S., Gonzalez, J., & Nolan, D. (n.d.). *Principles and Techniques of Data Science*. <a href="https://www.textbook.ds100.org" target=_blank>https://www.textbook.ds100.org</a> <br>
Note: Chapter 7 covers web technologies but the book is an excellent introduction to quantitative data analysis in Python in general.

Sweigart, A. (2015). *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*. <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e" target=_blank>https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e</a><br>
Note: Chapter 12 is a readable treatment of the practical and technical aspects of web-scraping.

### Python

Brooker, P. (2020). *Programming with Python for Social Scientists*. London: SAGE Publications Ltd. <br>
Note: One of the best (and few) introductions to computational methods for social science research; mixes theoretical and practical content very well.

Downey, A. (2015). *Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist*. Needham, Massachusetts: Green Tea Press. <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2" target=_blank>http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2</a> <br>
Note: A thorough and clear account of the main features of Python.

King's College London (2019). *Code Camp*. <a href="https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/code-camp" target=_blank>https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/code-camp</a> <br>
Note: A brilliant set of notebooks and lessons for learning the fundamentals of Python.

VanderPlas, J. (2016). *Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data*. <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/" target=_blank>https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/</a> <br>
Note: An in-depth treatment of core data science tasks in Python - calculations, data frames, visualisation and machine learning.
