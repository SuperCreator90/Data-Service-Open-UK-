    "## Collecting data from online databases using an API\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Application Programming Interface (API) is\n",
    "> a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service\" (Oxford English Dictionary). \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence: an API acts as an intermediary between software applications. It performs this role by providing a set of protocols/standards for making *requests* and formulating *responses* between applications. For example, a smart phone application might need real-time traffic data from an online database. An API can valididate the smart phone's request for data, and handle the online database's response (i.e., the transfer of data to the application). In the absence of an API, the smart phone application would need to know a lot more technical information about the online database in order to communicate with it. But thanks to the API, it only needs to know how to formulate a request that the API understands, which then communicates the request to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an API's role as similar to that of a translator faciliating a conversation between two individuals who do not speak the same language. Neither individual needs to know the other's language, just how to formulate their response in a way the translator can understand. In sum, an API simplifies how applications communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you want to learn more about APIs, especially from a technical perspective, we highly recommend one of our previous webinars: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffSQHPHO_c0\" target=_blank>What are APIs?</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons to interact with an API\n",
    "\n",
    "Many public, private and charitable institutions collect and share data of value to social scientists. Often they deposit their data to a data portal - e.g., <a href=\"https://data.gov.uk/\" target=_blank>UK Government Open Data</a> -, allowing you to download the files as and when needed. However, another approach they can adopt is to allow access to the underlying information that is stored in their database through an API. Using this method, individuals can send a customised *request* for information to the database; if the request is valid, the database *responds* by providing you with the information you asked for. Think of using an API as the difference between downloading a raw data file which then needs to be filtered to arrive at the information you need, and performing the filtering when you request the data, so only what you need is returned (the API method).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve into writing code to capture data through an API, let's clearly state the logic underpinning the technique."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Logic of using an API\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by identifying an online database containing information of interest. Then we need to **know** the following:\n",
    "1. The location of the API (i.e., web address) through which the database can be accessed. For example, the UK Police API can be accessed via <a href=\"https://data.police.uk/api\" target=_blank>https://data.police.uk/api</a>.\n",
    "2. The terms of use associated with the API. Many APIs restrict the number of requests you can make over a given time period, while others require registration in order to authenicate who is trying to access the data. For example, the UK Police API does not require you to provide authentication but restricts the number of requests for data you can make (15 per second) - the number of allowable requests is known as the *rate limit*.\n",
    "3. The location of the data of interest on the API. For example, data on street-level crime from the UK Police API is available at: <a href=\"https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street\" target=_blank>https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street</a>. The location of the data is known as its *endpoint*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can usually find all of the information we need by reading the API's documentation e.g., <a href=\"https://data.police.uk/docs/\" target=_blank>https://data.police.uk/docs/</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to **do** the following:\n",
    "4. Register your use of the API (if required).\n",
    "5. Request data from the endpoint of interest, supplying authentication if required. This process is known as *making a call* to the API.\n",
    "6. Write this data to a file for future use."

Then we declare a variable containing the term we are interested in searching for (`searchterm`). Next, we define a variable to store the API key that is needed when making the request (`auth`). Finally we concatenate these separate elements to form a valid web address that can be requested from the API (`webadd`). <br> The next step is to use the `get()` method of the `requests` module to request the web address, and in the same line of code, we store the results of the request in a variable called `response`. Finally, we check whether the request was successful by calling on the `status_code` attribute of the `response` variable.\n",

These cells have large numbers of receptors – known as Ace-2 receptors – on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) “This virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,” says the virologist Prof Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p> \\n<p>Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell’s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus.

Antibodies generated by the body’s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.</p> \\n<p>“A Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus’s success,” adds Ball. “Many people don’t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.”</p> \\n<p>By contrast, Sars – which is also caused by a coronavirus – makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others – by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \\n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \\n  <div>\\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\\n  </div>\\n </gu-atom> \\n</figure> \\n<h2>Why does the virus sometimes cause death?</h2> \\n<p>Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.</p> \\n<p>Even worse, in some cases, a person’s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/\">cytokine storm.</a> (In Greek, “cyto” means cell and “kino” means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.</p> \\n<p>Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.</p> \\n<h2><strong>Are we protected for life if we get infected?</strong></h2> \\n<p>Doctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/heres-how-body-gains-immunity-coronavirus\">antibodies are made by the immune system</a>, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.</p> \\n<p>“It is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,” says the virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. “And the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections – but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.”</p> \\n<p>Instead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. “That is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,” says Skinner. “That means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic – which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.”</p> \\n<p>The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. “We have got to consider this pandemic from the virus’s position,” he says. “It is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.”</p> \\n<p>In the end, it will be the development and rollout of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.</p> \\n<h2>When will we get a vaccine?</h2> \\n<p>On 9 April, the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\">journal </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\">Nature</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5\"> reported that 78 vaccine projects</a> had been launched round the globe – with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71bd74e2bdb349a18119fec7e436bb5e029b72e9\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71bd74e2bdb349a18119fec7e436bb5e029b72e9/0_66_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a “Vaccine COVID-19” sticker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the globe, there are 78 vaccine projects.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>This remarkable response raises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/lockdowns-cant-end-until-covid-19-vaccine-found-study-says\">hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed</a> in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.</p> \\n<p>As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process – by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy. “This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.</p> \\n<p>Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.” The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.</p> \\n<p>But deliberately infecting people – in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial – is controversial. “This will have to be thought through very carefully,” says Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don’t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.”</p> \\n<ul> \\n <li><p>This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.</p> \\n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71bd74e2bdb349a18119fec7e436bb5e029b72e9\"> \\n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71bd74e2bdb349a18119fec7e436bb5e029b72e9/0_66_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a “Vaccine COVID-19” sticker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \\n <figcaption> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the globe, there are 78 vaccine projects.</span> \\n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters</span> \\n </figcaption> \\n</figure> \\n<p>This remarkable response raises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/lockdowns-cant-end-until-covid-19-vaccine-found-study-says\">hopes that a Covid-19 vaccine could be developed</a> in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.</p> \\n<p>As a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process – by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy. “This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.</p> \\n<p>Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.” The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.</p> \\n<p>But deliberately infecting people – in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial – is controversial. “This will have to be thought through very carefully,” says Prof Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don’t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.”</p> \\n<ul> \\n <li><p>This article was amended on 12 April 2020.
