# Interactive coding materials

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output.

If you would like to run and/or edit the code without installing any software on your machine, click on the button below. This launches a **Binder** service allowing you to interact with the code through your web browser - as it is temporary, you will lose your work when you log out and you will be booted out if you donâ€™t do anything for a long time.

Once Binder has been launched, click on the `code` folder and select which notebook you want to run. (*Don't worry if takes up to a minute to launch*)

### Launch Web-scraping for Social Science Research as a Binder service: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/web-scraping/master)<br>

Alternatively, you can download the notebook files and run them on your own machine. See our guidance on installing Python and Jupyter [here](LINK).
