# Interactive coding materials

We have developed a number of Jupyter notebooks containing a mix of Python code, narrative and output.

If you would like to run and/or edit the code without installing any software on your machine, click on the button below. This launches a temporary web service (known as **Binder**) allowing you to interact with the code - as it is temporary, you will lose your work when you log out and you will be booted out if you donâ€™t do anything for a long time.

### Launch Web-scraping for Social Science Research as a web service: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/new-forms-of-data/master/code)<br>

Alternatively, you can download the notebook files and run them on your own machine. See our guidance on installing Python and Jupyter [here](LINK).
