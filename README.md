# Web-scraping for Social Science Research

Vast swathes of our social interactions and personal behaviours are now conducted online and/or captured digitally. In addition to common sources such as social media/network platforms and text corpora, websites and online databases contain rich information of relevance to social science research. Thus, computational methods for collecting data from the web are an increasingly important component of a social scientistâ€™s toolkit.

## Topics

The following topics are covered under this training series:
1. *Case Study* - understand the research potential of web-scraping through examining a published piece of social science research. 
2. *Websites as a Source of Data* - learn how to write collect data from websites using Python.  
3. *APIs as a Source of Data* - learn how to download data from online databases using Python and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

## Materials

Each topic has a suite of learning resources associated with it, including webinar recordings, slides, and sample Python code contained in interactive notebooks:
* [webinars]() - re-watch recordings of our webinars and download the underpinning slides.
* [notebooks]() - run and/or download web-scraping code using our Jupyter notebook resources.
* [reading-list]() - explore further resources including articles, books, online resources and more.
* [faq]() - read through some of the frequently asked questions that are posed during our webinars.
* [installation]() - view instructions for how to download and install Python and other packages necessary for working with new forms of data.
